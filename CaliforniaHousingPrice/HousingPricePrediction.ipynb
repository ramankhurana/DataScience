    "\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and get a grasp of the big pictue. \n",

    "### 1. Frame the problem \n",
    "As said, we have the housing dataset for California and we want to build the a model which can predict the price of house given other features of the dataset. So broadly, this is a supervised learning problem, where we will predict the price of the house, i.e. we need to use the regression algorithm. The dataset has many features like, loaction, age of house, rooms, population, income etc, all of these influence the price of house and hence this is  a multivariate regression problem to be solved. \n",

    "We are given that the existing solution do exist to predict the housing price, using some manual, time expensive and budget expensive and comes with an error of 15%. \n",

    "#### Performance metric \n",
    "##### 1. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used metric for regression problem is RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). \n",
    "\n",
    "$ RMSE  = \\sqrt (\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x^{i}) - y^{i})^{2} ) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where, \n",
    "- m: number of instance/row on which performance (RMSE) is measured\n",
    "- $x^{i}$: Vector of all the input feature values (EXCLUDING OUTPUT) of $i^{th}$ instance in the data, and $y^{i}$ is the label of this vactor, or true value of the feature to be predicted, housing price in this case. \n",
    "- $h(x^{i})$: Predicted value given the input features $x^{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "[RMSE using sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#mean-squared-error)  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. MAE (Mean Average Error) \n",
    "MAE is another metric used for the regression problems, specially when there are known outliers in the dataset. \n",
    "In such cases it is better to average out the errors using MAE: \n",
    "\n",
    "$MAE = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |(h(x^{i}) - y^{i} |$\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 3. $R^{2} score$\n",
    "Another important metric for regression exercise is $R^{2}$ score, also called coefficient of determination. It represents the proportion of variance (of y) that has been explained by the independent variables in the model. \n",
    "It provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model, through the proportion of explained variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "$R^{2} score (h(x^{i}),  y^{i} )$ = 1 - $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} y^{i} - h(x^{i})}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{i}-\\bar{y}}$\n",

    "#### Train and test data split \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go further looking at the data, this is the best time to set aside a part of data for testing. We haven't checked much details of the data yet but it is suitable to set aside test data as our mind is a great pattern recognition system and we might spot some pattern in the test dataset which will drive the decision to choose the model later on. This situation will lead to optimistic results on test data (while estimating the generalised errors) but the results on the unseen new data will not be as good as expected from test dataset. This is called *data snooping bias*. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Random splitting the data: \n",
    "Creating a test set theoritically is very simple, just pick 20% of the instances randomly and set them aside. If we split the dataset into test and train randomly, but if we run the program again we will have a different set of test instances, and over the time we will see the full dataset, and this is what we want to avoid. Therefore, it is the best practise to keep the random number state fixed (say 42). So it will always generated the same shuffeled indices for test and train splitting. One of the method available in the sklean is train_test_split which does this jobs in one line. This split the dataset randomly (and consistenly same set of indices everytime using random_state argument) and it has possibility to send multiple datasets with same number of rows. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " <font color=\"red\"> Note: However this method breaks when we are continuously updating the data. In that situation an unique instance (row) identifier is needed to decide whether or not a given instance will enter the test dataset. E.g. if we compute hash of each instance's identifier and keep only the last byte (i.e. 8 bits, it can store  number upto 255, i.e. 256 values). Now if we put a condition that the instance will enter the test set if this byte is $<$ 51 then it is almost 20% of 256. This will ensure that the test set will remain consistent accross multiple runs even if the dataset is updated. </font>  \n",
    "    \n",
    " ##### 2. Stratified Shuffle split \n",
    " \n",
    " The random sampling is generally fine if the dataset is large enough which is not always the case. But if the dataset is not large enough we run into the risk of *sampling bias*. \n",
    " \n",
    " <font color=\"green\"> Example: Suppose a company want to take a survey of 1000 people in US and ask a few question. Now it is given that the male/female % in US is about 48.7/51.3%. To conduct the survey the company must ensure that the sample population is good representative of the whole population. Here I talk about only one parameter of the population, i.e. gender ratio. It should be ensured that out of 1000 people approximately 513 are female and 897 are male. This method to do the sampling is called *stratified sampling*. the sample population, and the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called *strata*. If they use purely random sampling then there is 12% chance of smapling a skewed test set with either less than 49% female or more than 54% female. And in either way the survey result will be significantly biased.  </font>"
