    "\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and get a grasp of the big pictue. \n",
    "2. Get the data \n",
    "3. Exploratory data analysis and gain insights. \n",
    "4. Prepare data to extract the features hidden in the data, Feature enginnering. \n",
    "5. Short list (and explore them) the possible models which can be tried on the given model, based on the knowledge gain from insights. \n",
    "6. Finetune these models and combine into a reliable and the best solution. \n",
    "7. Presentation of the solution \n",

    "### 1. Frame the problem \n",
    "As said, we have the housing dataset for California and we want to build the a model which can predict the price of house given other features of the dataset. So broadly, this is a supervised learning problem, where we will predict the price of the house, i.e. we need to use the regression algorithm. The dataset has many features like, loaction, age of house, rooms, population, income etc, all of these influence the price of house and hence this is  a multivariate regression problem to be solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are given that the existing solution do exist to predict the housing price, using some manual, time expensive and budget expensive and comes with an error of 15%. \n",

    "#### Performance metric \n",
    "##### 1. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used metric for regression problem is RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). \n",
    "\n",
    "$ RMSE  = \\sqrt (\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x^{i}) - y^{i})^{2} ) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where, \n",
    "- m: number of instance/row on which performance (RMSE) is measured\n",
    "- $x^{i}$: Vector of all the input feature values (EXCLUDING OUTPUT) of $i^{th}$ instance in the data, and $y^{i}$ is the label of this vactor, or true value of the feature to be predicted, housing price in this case. \n",
    "- $h(x^{i})$: Predicted value given the input features $x^{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "[RMSE using sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#mean-squared-error)  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. MAE (Mean Average Error) \n",
    "MAE is another metric used for the regression problems, specially when there are known outliers in the dataset. \n",
    "In such cases it is better to average out the errors using MAE: \n",
    "\n",
    "$MAE = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |(h(x^{i}) - y^{i} |$\n",
    "\n",
    "[MAE using sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#mean-absolute-error)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. $R^{2} score$\n",
    "Another important metric for regression exercise is $R^{2}$ score, also called coefficient of determination. It represents the proportion of variance (of y) that has been explained by the independent variables in the model. \n",
    "It provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model, through the proportion of explained variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "$R^{2} score (h(x^{i}),  y^{i} )$ = 1 - $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} y^{i} - h(x^{i})}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{i}-\\bar{y}}$\n",
