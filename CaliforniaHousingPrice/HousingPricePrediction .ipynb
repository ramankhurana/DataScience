The project is part of the book \"Hands-on machine learning with sk-learn and tensorflow\" and give a lot of information in a concise form.

    "As said, we have the housing dataset for California and we want to build the a model which can predict the price of house given other features of the dataset. So broadly, this is a supervised learning problem, where we will predict the price of the house, i.e. we need to use the regression algorithm. The dataset has many features like, loaction, age of house, rooms, population, income etc, all of these influence the price of house and hence this is  a multivariate regression problem to be solved. \n",
